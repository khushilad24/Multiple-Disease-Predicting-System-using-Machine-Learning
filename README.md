# 🧠 Multiple Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning & Streamlit

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Multiple Disease Prediction System** is a Machine Learning web application built with **Python** and **Streamlit** that predicts the likelihood of three critical diseases:

- ❤️ **Heart Disease**
- 💉 **Diabetes**
- 🧍‍♂️ **Parkinson’s Disease**

By analyzing key health metrics and voice features (in the case of Parkinson’s), this system supports **early diagnosis** and **proactive treatment planning**. It is particularly aimed at **improving healthcare accessibility** via a lightweight, easy-to-use web interface.

## 🎯 Objective

To create a unified platform that:
- Leverages machine learning for disease prediction
- Allows healthcare professionals or individuals to assess disease risk
- Promotes awareness and encourages timely medical check-ups

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The system uses **pre-trained machine learning models** on medical datasets to classify whether a person is likely to have a particular disease. Here's how it functions:

1. **User Input**: Users provide clinical parameters (e.g., blood pressure, glucose level, voice frequency)
2. **Preprocessing**: Inputs are cleaned, scaled, and transformed to match the training data format
3. **Prediction**: A trained ML model (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.) returns a prediction
4. **Result**: The system displays a result indicating whether the user is likely to have the disease
